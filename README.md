# Interpreting-Machine-Learning-and-Neural-Network-models

The purpose of this repository is to show some of the techniques that can be used to understand the reason behind the complex machine learning model decision

The repo contains three notebooks: <br>
1.Data transform notebook, to clean the data <br>
2.Random Forest Model explanation using: Shap and Partial dependence plot <br>
3. DNN model explanation using LIME methodology <br>

The repo also contains an abstract describing the methods followed in this project
